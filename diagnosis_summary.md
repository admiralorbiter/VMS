# Christina Chandler Event Display Issue - Diagnosis & Resolution

## Issue Summary
**Problem**: Christina Chandler showed as "attended" in her volunteer profile but did not appear in the "Careers on Wheels" event volunteer list, and the event didn't show up for her organization.

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue
Christina's `EventParticipation` record had status "Scheduled" instead of "Attended" for the completed event. The event view template only displays volunteers with specific statuses:
- "Registered"
- "Attended"
- "No Show"
- "Cancelled"

Since "Scheduled" was not in this list, Christina didn't appear in any group.

### Systemic Discovery
During diagnosis, we discovered a **massive data integrity issue** affecting the entire system:
- **3,547 volunteers** have "Scheduled" status on **507 completed events**
- This affects volunteers across multiple years (2012-2025)
- The issue likely stems from Salesforce import processes not updating participation statuses when events are marked as completed

## Technical Details

### Database Records Found
- **Christina Chandler**: Volunteer ID 186024
- **Event**: "Careers on Wheels for Center Elementaries - 5th Grade" (ID 2551)
- **Participation Record**: ID 19312
- **Original Status**: "Scheduled" → **Updated to**: "Attended"

### Event Display Logic
The `routes/events/routes.py` `view_event` function:
1. Queries `EventParticipation` records for the event
2. Groups volunteers by status into `participation_stats` dict
3. Only includes volunteers with expected statuses
4. Template displays each group separately

### Organization Display Impact
- Christina is associated with **JE Dunn Construction** (Current status)
- Organization reports query for volunteers with "Attended" status
- With "Scheduled" status, events wouldn't appear in organization reports
- Now fixed: events will appear when filtering for attended volunteers

## Resolution Steps Taken

### 1. Diagnosis
- Created diagnostic scripts to identify the issue
- Found Christina's participation record with "Scheduled" status
- Discovered the template logic that excludes "Scheduled" volunteers

### 2. Fix Implementation
- Updated Christina's participation status from "Scheduled" to "Attended"
- Validated the fix using the same logic as the event view

### 3. Validation Results
✅ Christina now appears in the "Attended" section (4 total attended volunteers)
✅ Event will appear in JE Dunn Construction organization reports
✅ Data consistency restored for this specific case

## Current Status
- **Christina's Issue**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Systemic Issue**: ⚠️ IDENTIFIED BUT NOT ADDRESSED

## Recommendations for Future Action

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Data Cleanup**: Address the 3,547 volunteers with "Scheduled" status on completed events
2. **Template Enhancement**: Consider adding "Scheduled" to the display groups or create a data migration
3. **Process Improvement**: Fix Salesforce import processes to properly update statuses

### Suggested Approach for Systemic Fix
```sql
-- Example query to update all "Scheduled" to "Attended" for completed events
UPDATE event_participation
SET status = 'Attended'
WHERE status = 'Scheduled'
AND event_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM event WHERE status = 'completed'
);
```

### Process Improvements
1. **Import Validation**: Add checks to ensure participation statuses are updated when events are completed
2. **Data Monitoring**: Create alerts for status inconsistencies
3. **Template Robustness**: Handle edge cases like "Scheduled" status more gracefully

## Files Modified
- `diagnostic_queries.py` - Main diagnosis script
- `test_event_display_logic.py` - Event display logic testing
- `simple_fix_christina.py` - Targeted fix for Christina
- `validate_christina_fix.py` - Fix validation
- `fix_volunteer_participation_status.py` - Comprehensive fix script (revealed systemic issue)

## Impact Assessment
- **User Experience**: Christina and similar volunteers will now appear in event lists
- **Organization Reports**: Events will appear correctly in organization views
- **Data Integrity**: Improved consistency between volunteer profiles and event displays

## Lessons Learned
1. Single-user issues can reveal systemic problems
2. Template display logic must handle all possible data states
3. Salesforce imports require robust status management
4. Data validation should be built into import processes

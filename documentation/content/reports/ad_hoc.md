# Ad Hoc Queries

**Location**: `Reports > Ad Hoc`

The Ad Hoc Query builder allows staff to answer one-off questions that don't satisfy a full dashboard.

## Query Builder Features

-   **Filters**: Build complex AND/OR logic (e.g., "Volunteers from IBM" AND "Active in 2024").
-   **Fields**: Select which columns to display (Name, Email, Hours, etc.).
-   **Export**: Download results immediately to CSV.

## Common Use Cases
-   "List all volunteers who have an engineering background."
-   "Show me all events at Wyandotte High School last month."
-   "Find volunteers who haven't participated since 2023."

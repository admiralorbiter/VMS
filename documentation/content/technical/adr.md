## Recent Decisions

### 2025-08-17: Removed Salesforce Pathway Import System

**Decision:** Remove complex Salesforce pathway import; replace with simpler event affiliation via `pathway_events.py`.

**What Was Removed:**
- `models/pathways.py` — Complex Pathway model
- `routes/pathways/` — Entire pathways blueprint
- `routes/reports/pathways.py` — Pathway reports
- Database tables: `pathway_contacts`, `pathway_events`

**What Was Kept:**
- `routes/events/pathway_events.py` — Unaffiliated event sync
- Simple `pathway` field in `EventAttendanceDetail`
- Pathway event types (`PATHWAY_CAMPUS_VISITS`, `PATHWAY_WORKPLACE_VISITS`)

**Benefits:**
- Simpler, maintainable codebase
- Focus on actual data relationships
- Reduced database complexity

### 2026-02-27: D-004 — Auto-Link TeacherProgress to Teacher on Import

**Context:** The teacher roster import (`utils/roster_import.py`) created `TeacherProgress` records from district spreadsheets but never linked them to `Teacher` records (created separately by Pathful/Salesforce imports). This caused:
- `TeacherProgress.teacher_id` was always `None` (0/464 linked)
- `Teacher.school_id` was `None` for 60% of records (5,846/9,692)
- Manually-added session teachers didn't appear in the teacher usage dashboard
- The two data systems (spreadsheet imports vs session imports) were completely disconnected

**Decision:** Add an automatic post-import linking step to `import_roster()` that:
1. Matches `TeacherProgress` → `Teacher` by first/last name (case-insensitive)
2. Sets `Teacher.school_id` by fuzzy-matching the `building` name to the School table
3. Also updates `teacher_detail` and `compute_teacher_progress` to use both `EventTeacher` records AND `event.educators` text field for session matching

**Consequences:**
- ✅ 280/464 TeacherProgress records now linked to Teacher entities
- ✅ 56 Teacher `school_id` values automatically set
- ✅ Dashboard now shows sessions from both import paths (Pathful text matching + EventTeacher DB links)
- ⚠️ 184 TeacherProgress records remain unlinked (no matching Teacher entity exists — these teachers haven't appeared in any Pathful session)
- ⚠️ 3 buildings (Douglass, Grant, JFK) have no School record and are skipped

**Files Changed:**
- `utils/roster_import.py` — `_find_school_by_building_name()`, `_link_progress_to_teachers()`
- `routes/district/tenant_teacher_usage.py` — `teacher_detail()`, `compute_teacher_progress()`

### 2026-02-27: D-005 — Sprint 1: Centralized Teacher Service + Model Hardening

**Context:** Teacher records were created inline across 5+ route files (`routes/virtual/routes.py`, `usage.py`, `pathful_import.py`, etc.) using inconsistent matching logic. This caused duplicates and made the system fragile. Name matching in `roster_import.py` used raw `func.lower()` instead of the shared `normalize_name()` function.

**Decision:**
1. Create `services/teacher_service.py` with a single `find_or_create_teacher()` entry point using prioritized matching: `salesforce_individual_id` → email → normalized name
2. Add `cached_email` column to Teacher (named `cached_email` instead of `primary_email` to avoid shadowing the existing `Contact.primary_email` property)
3. Add `import_source` column to Teacher for data provenance tracking
4. Add `UniqueConstraint('tenant_id', 'email', 'academic_year')` to TeacherProgress
5. Refactor `_link_progress_to_teachers()` to use email-first matching + shared `normalize_name()`

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Single entry point for all teacher creation — future sprints wire routes through the service
- ✅ Email matching is now the primary strategy (higher confidence than name matching)
- ✅ TeacherProgress duplicates prevented at the DB level
- ✅ `MatchInfo` dataclass provides transparency for debugging matches
- ⚠️ Existing routes still create teachers inline (Sprint 3 will redirect them)
- ⚠️ `cached_email` needs backfill from Email model records via `backfill_primary_emails()`

**Files Changed:**
- `services/teacher_service.py` — **NEW**: `find_or_create_teacher()`, `backfill_primary_emails()`, `MatchInfo`
- `models/teacher.py` — `cached_email`, `import_source` columns
- `models/teacher_progress.py` — `UniqueConstraint`
- `utils/roster_import.py` — email-first + normalized matching
- `tests/unit/services/test_teacher_service.py` — **NEW**: 13 tests
- `scripts/migrations/sprint1_teacher_foundation.py` — **NEW**: migration script

### 2026-02-27: D-006 — Sprint 2: EventTeacher as Single Source of Truth

**Context:** Teacher-session links were stored in two disconnected ways: (1) `event.educators` text field (semicolon-separated names from Pathful import), and (2) `EventTeacher` FK records (from session edit UI). The dashboard used a fragile dual-path counting merge that could double-count or miss sessions.

**Decision:**
1. Make `EventTeacher` the canonical source of truth for teacher-session links
2. Create `sync_event_participant_fields()` to regenerate all 4 text cache fields from FK tables
3. Create `ensure_event_teacher()` for idempotent EventTeacher creation
4. Wire Pathful import to create EventTeacher records (previously only set text)
5. Add sync calls to session edit/create handlers
6. Refactor dashboard counting to EventTeacher-first with text fallback

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Single authoritative path for teacher-session relationships
- ✅ Text fields are now a cache, not a source of truth
- ✅ Dashboard counting simplified — EventTeacher-first with text fallback
- ✅ Backfill completed (15,838+ EventTeacher records)
- ✅ Text fields are now a cache, not a source of truth
- ✅ EventTeacher is primary data source (D-008)

**Files Changed:**
- `services/teacher_service.py` — `sync_event_participant_fields()`, `ensure_event_teacher()`
- EventTeacher backfill — **completed**: 15,838+ records created from educators text (one-time operation)
- `routes/virtual/pathful_import.py` — create EventTeacher on teacher match
- `routes/virtual/usage.py` — sync cache in edit + create
- `routes/district/tenant_teacher_usage.py` — EventTeacher-first counting

### 2026-02-27: D-007 — Sprint 3: All Teacher Creation Through Service Layer

**Context:** 7 inline `Teacher()` constructor calls in route files bypassed the centralized matching logic (Salesforce ID, email, normalized name). This meant duplicate-prone name-only matching and no `import_source` provenance tracking.

**Decision:** Replace all 7 inline sites with `find_or_create_teacher()` from `teacher_service.py`. Delete obsolete `fix_duplicate_teachers.py`.

**Consequences:**
- ✅ All Teacher creation uses the full matching chain (SF ID → email → normalized name)
- ✅ `import_source` tracked on every creation (`"spreadsheet"`, `"manual"`)
- ✅ Zero inline `Teacher()` calls remain in routes
- ✅ `fix_duplicate_teachers.py` deleted — Sprint 1 constraints prevent duplicates

---

### 2026-02-28: D-008 — Sprint 4: EventTeacher-Primary Counting (Resolved)

**Context:** Sprint 4 tried three counting approaches:
1. EventTeacher-only (failed: 0 EventTeacher records existed)
2. EventTeacher-primary after backfill (failed: only 60% of TeacherProgress had `teacher_id`, global `matched_event_ids` excluded events from unlinked teachers)
3. Text-primary + EventTeacher-supplementary (worked but fragile)

**Decision:** Created 184 missing Teacher records from TeacherProgress data, linking all 464 records (100%). Re-ran backfill (15,838+ EventTeacher records, 97.5% coverage). Switched to EventTeacher-primary, text-supplementary.

**Lesson:** EventTeacher-primary requires ALL TeacherProgress → Teacher links. The root cause of under-counting wasn't the counting logic — it was missing Teacher records.

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Dashboard counts verified: 162 goals achieved (matches pre-refactor ±1)
- ✅ EventTeacher is primary data source — reliable FK lookups, no fuzzy matching
- ✅ Text-supplementary catches remaining 2.5% edge cases
- ✅ EventTeacher backfill completed (15,838+ records, one-time operation)

### 2026-02-28: D-009 — Task 4.4: KCKPS Schools + District-Scoped Matching

**Context:** KCKPS district (ID=23) had 0 School records. `_find_school_by_building_name()` searched all 177 schools globally, causing cross-district false matches (e.g. "Banneker" matching a Missouri school).

**Decision:** Seed 28 School records from TeacherProgress building names with deterministic IDs (`kckps-{name}`). Add `district_id` parameter to `_find_school_by_building_name()` — search within district first, global fallback only if no match.

**Consequences:**
- ✅ All 28 KCKPS buildings match to correct, district-scoped schools
- ✅ No cross-district false matches
- ✅ All 28 KCKPS buildings have School records (seeded during Sprint 4.4)

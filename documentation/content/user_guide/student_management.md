# Student Roster & Attendance

This guide explains how to manage student participation in events.

## 1. Rostering Students

**Rostering** is the process of associating students with an event before it happens.

1.  Open an **Event** (In-Person or Virtual).
2.  Go to the **Students** tab.
3.  Click **"Add Students"**.
4.  Search for students by name or school/district.
5.  Select and **Add** to the roster.

## 2. Marking Attendance

After an event, you must record who actually attended.

1.  Open the **Event**.
2.  Go to the **Students** tab.
3.  Use the **Attendance Status** dropdowns:
    -   **Attended**: Student was present.
    -   **Absent**: Student did not show up.
    -   **Excused**: Known absence.
4.  Changes save automatically.

## 3. Reporting Impact

Attendance data feeds directly into:
-   **Student Reach Reports**: Unique students served.
-   **District Dashboards**: Completion rates.

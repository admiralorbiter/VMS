# Quality Scoring Engine Implementation Plan

**Phase**: 3.4 - Week 3-4
**Component**: Quality Scoring Engine
**Status**: PLANNING
**Priority**: HIGH

## üéØ **Overview**

The Quality Scoring Engine is the core component that transforms raw validation results into meaningful quality scores. It provides:
- **Weighted scoring algorithms** for different validation types
- **Configurable quality thresholds** per entity and validation type
- **Multi-dimensional quality assessment** across all validation dimensions
- **Historical score comparison** and improvement tracking

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

### **Core Components**

1. **QualityScoringService** - Main service for calculating quality scores
2. **ScoreWeightingEngine** - Manages weights and scoring algorithms
3. **ThresholdManager** - Handles quality thresholds and configurations
4. **ScoreCalculator** - Performs actual score calculations
5. **QualityBaseline** - Manages baseline scores and comparisons

### **Data Flow**

```

```

## üìä **Scoring Algorithms**

### **1. Field Completeness Scoring**
```python
# Formula: (Completed Fields / Total Required Fields) * 100
field_completeness_score = (completed_fields / total_required_fields) * 100

# Weighted by field importance
weighted_score = sum(field_score * field_weight for field in fields)
```

### **2. Data Type Accuracy Scoring**
```python
# Formula: (Correct Data Types / Total Fields) * 100
data_type_score = (correct_types / total_fields) * 100

# Penalty for critical type mismatches
final_score = data_type_score - (critical_errors * penalty_multiplier)
```

### **3. Business Rule Compliance Scoring**
```python
# Formula: (Passed Rules / Total Rules) * 100
rule_compliance_score = (passed_rules / total_rules) * 100

# Severity-based weighting
weighted_score = sum(
    rule_score * severity_weight[rule.severity]
    for rule in rules
)
```

### **4. Relationship Integrity Scoring**
```python
# Formula: (Valid Relationships / Total Relationships) * 100
relationship_score = (valid_relationships / total_relationships) * 100

# Foreign key validation
fk_score = (valid_fks / total_fks) * 100
```

### **5. Composite Quality Score**
```python
# Weighted combination of all scores
composite_score = (
    field_completeness_score * field_weight +
    data_type_score * data_type_weight +
    rule_compliance_score * rule_weight +
    relationship_score * relationship_weight
) / total_weight
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration System**

### **Quality Thresholds**
```yaml
quality_thresholds:
  volunteer:
    field_completeness: 80.0
    data_type_accuracy: 95.0
    business_rule_compliance: 85.0
    relationship_integrity: 90.0
    overall_quality: 82.0

  organization:
    field_completeness: 85.0
    data_type_accuracy: 90.0
    business_rule_compliance: 80.0
    relationship_integrity: 85.0
    overall_quality: 85.0
```

### **Scoring Weights**
```yaml
scoring_weights:
  field_completeness: 0.25
  data_type_accuracy: 0.30
  business_rule_compliance: 0.25
  relationship_integrity: 0.20

  severity_weights:
    critical: 1.0
    error: 0.8
    warning: 0.5
    info: 0.2
```

### **Penalty Multipliers**
```yaml
penalty_multipliers:
  critical_error: 10.0
  data_type_mismatch: 5.0
  missing_required_field: 8.0
  invalid_relationship: 6.0
```

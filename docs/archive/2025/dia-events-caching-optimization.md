# DIA Events Report Caching Optimization

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Completed

## Overview

Optimized the DIA Events report route (`/reports/dia-events`) by implementing a robust caching mechanism similar to other report routes in the system. This optimization significantly reduces database queries and improves page load times.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Cache Model** (`models/reports.py`)

Created a new cache model `DIAEventsReportCache` with the following features:

- **Table**: `dia_events_report_cache`
- **Fields**:
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `report_data`: JSON field storing serialized event and volunteer data
  - `last_updated`: Timestamp for cache invalidation (defaults to current UTC time)

- **Purpose**: Stores pre-computed DIA events report data including:
  - Filled events with volunteer details
  - Unfilled events needing volunteers
  - Event metadata (date, location, school, status)
  - Volunteer contact information (name, email, organization)

### 2. **Route Optimization** (`routes/reports/dia_events.py`)

#### New Helper Functions:

1. **`_serialize_for_cache(filled_events, unfilled_events)`**
   - Converts Event objects and datetime fields to JSON-serializable format
   - Handles nested data structures (events with volunteers)
   - Returns serialized dict ready for database storage

2. **`_deserialize_from_cache(payload)`**
   - Converts serialized JSON data back to the format expected by the template
   - Parses ISO datetime strings back to datetime objects
   - Reconstructs nested event and volunteer data structures
   - Returns tuple: `(filled_events, unfilled_events)`

3. **`_is_cache_valid(cache_record, max_age_hours=24)`**
   - Checks if cache is still valid based on age
   - Default cache lifetime: 24 hours
   - Handles timezone-aware datetime comparisons
   - Returns boolean indicating cache validity

4. **`_query_dia_events()`**
   - Extracted database query logic into separate function
   - Queries all upcoming DIA events (DIA and DIA_CLASSROOM_SPEAKER types)
   - Fetches volunteer participations with email addresses
   - Organizes events into filled and unfilled categories
   - Returns tuple: `(filled_events, unfilled_events)`

#### Updated Route Handler:

The `dia_events()` route now follows this workflow:

1. **Check for cache refresh request** (`?refresh=1` parameter)
2. **Try to load from cache**:
   - Query the cache table
   - Validate cache age (< 24 hours)
   - If valid, deserialize and use cached data
3. **If no valid cache**:
   - Query fresh data from database
   - Serialize the results
   - Save to cache (create new or update existing)
4. **Render template** with data and cache timestamp

### 3. **Database Migration**

Created Alembic migration: `17a6ad434816_add_dia_events_report_cache_table.py`

**Upgrade**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE dia_events_report_cache (
    id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    report_data JSON NOT NULL,
    last_updated DATETIME(timezone=True) DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

**Downgrade**:
```sql
DROP TABLE dia_events_report_cache
```

Also fixed a previous migration issue where `2e3f476a022a_remove_pathway_tables.py` was trying to drop non-existent tables. Added existence checks before dropping tables.

### 4. **Template Updates** (`templates/reports/events/dia_events.html`)

Added UI elements for cache management:

1. **Refresh Cache Button**:
   - Located in page header next to title
   - Links to same route with `?refresh=1` parameter
   - Forces cache refresh when clicked

2. **Cache Status Display**:
   - Shows when data was last cached
   - Displays cache age in hours
   - Indicates 24-hour expiration policy
   - Only visible when cache exists

## Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization:
- Every page load triggered multiple database queries:
  - Query for all upcoming DIA events
  - For each event: Query EventParticipation records
  - For each volunteer: Query Email records (primary and fallback)
- **Estimated queries per page load**: 20-50+ (depending on event count)

### After Optimization:
- **First page load** (or after cache expires):
  - Same queries as before to build cache
  - Additional cache save operation
- **Subsequent page loads** (within 24 hours):
  - Single query to check cache
  - Zero queries to events/volunteers/emails tables
- **Estimated queries per page load**: 1 (cache hit) vs 20-50+ (cache miss)

### Expected Performance Gains:
- **Page load time**: ~80-90% reduction on cached loads
- **Database load**: ~95% reduction during cache validity period
- **Response time**: Sub-second response for cached data vs multi-second queries

## Cache Management

### Cache Lifetime:
- **Default**: 24 hours
- **Configurable**: Can be adjusted via `max_age_hours` parameter in `_is_cache_valid()`

### Cache Invalidation:
1. **Automatic**: After 24 hours
2. **Manual**: Click "Refresh Cache" button on report page
3. **Programmatic**: Use `?refresh=1` URL parameter

### Cache Storage:
- **Format**: JSON in database
- **Size**: Minimal - only stores upcoming events
- **Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "filled_events": [
      {
        "event": {...event_data...},
        "volunteers": [{...volunteer_data...}]
      }
    ],
    "unfilled_events": [
      {...event_data...}
    ]
  }
  ```

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing:
1. **First Load**: Visit `/reports/dia-events` - should query database
2. **Second Load**: Refresh page - should use cache (faster)
3. **Check Cache**: Verify cache info banner shows correct timestamp
4. **Force Refresh**: Click "Refresh Cache" button - should re-query
5. **Verify Data**: Ensure filled/unfilled events display correctly

### Edge Cases to Test:
- Empty events list (no DIA events)
- Events with no volunteers
- Events with multiple volunteers
- Volunteers without email addresses
- Cache expiration (wait 24+ hours or modify timestamp)

### Performance Testing:
```python
# Add to route for timing
from time import perf_counter
start = perf_counter()
# ... route logic ...
print(f"Route execution: {(perf_counter() - start) * 1000:.1f} ms")
```

## Code Quality

### Follows Project Standards:
- ✅ Consistent with other report routes (recent_volunteers, volunteers_by_event)
- ✅ Uses same caching pattern and helper function structure
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings with type hints
- ✅ Proper error handling (rollback on cache save failure)
- ✅ Zero linter errors

### Best Practices:
- Timezone-aware datetime handling
- Defensive programming (existence checks, fallbacks)
- Separation of concerns (query, serialize, cache logic separated)
- Non-blocking cache failures (reports continue if cache save fails)

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements:
1. **Event-driven invalidation**: Clear cache when events/volunteers are modified
2. **Partial caching**: Cache filled and unfilled events separately
3. **Background refresh**: Refresh cache automatically via scheduled task
4. **Cache warming**: Pre-populate cache after data imports
5. **Cache metrics**: Track cache hit/miss rates for monitoring

### Configuration Options:
```python
# Could add to config/settings
DIA_EVENTS_CACHE_HOURS = 24
DIA_EVENTS_CACHE_ENABLED = True
```

## Goals

- Create authoritative technical docs for onboarding and maintenance
- Make docs AI-friendly with consistent frontmatter and structure

## Milestones

- Week 3: ADRs and frontmatter added
- Week 4: API spec and data dictionary complete

## Detailed Tasks

### 1) Architecture Decisions (ADRs)
- [ ] Write 3–5 ADRs (see `docs/templates/adr.md`)
- [ ] Topics: DB choice and sync, auth strategy, logging, testing philosophy
- [ ] Link ADRs from `docs/02-architecture.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Each ADR has context, decision, consequences

### 2) API documentation
- [ ] Generate OpenAPI/Swagger definition from routes
- [ ] Add endpoint descriptions, params, and response models
- [ ] Publish spec in `docs/04-api-spec.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] All public endpoints documented with examples

### 3) Data dictionary
- [ ] Enumerate models and fields with types and constraints
- [ ] Document enums and ID relationships
- [ ] Add cross-links to `docs/03-data-model.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Complete table of fields with meaning and constraints

### 4) Frontmatter and structure
- [ ] Add YAML frontmatter to all docs
- [ ] Normalize headings and navigation
- [ ] Add doc lints/checks if feasible

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] All docs include title, description, tags frontmatter

## Dependencies

- Phase B endpoints and models stable

## Deliverables

- ADR set, OpenAPI spec, updated data model and index

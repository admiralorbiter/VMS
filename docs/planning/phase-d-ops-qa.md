## Goals

- Operational visibility, basic performance confidence, and recovery plan

## Milestones

- Week 5: Structured logs, scanners, backup docs, load test results

## Detailed Tasks

### 1) Structured logging and tracing
- [ ] Add `structlog` with JSON logs
- [ ] Inject request IDs/correlation IDs per request
- [ ] Ensure logs include user/action for critical events

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Logs are structured; request IDs present end-to-end

### 2) Security scanning
- [ ] Run `bandit` with tailored excludes
- [ ] Add dependency scanning with `safety`
- [ ] Document triage and waiver process

- [ ] 0 high severity issues; medium issues triaged

### 3) Backup and restore
- [ ] Document DB backup schedule and storage location
- [ ] Describe restore steps and verification
- [ ] Automate a smoke restore in a staging/dev environment

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Restore procedure verified end-to-end

### 4) Load testing
- [ ] Create basic Locust/JMeter scenario covering hot paths
- [ ] Capture RPS, latency P95, error rates
- [ ] Document findings and next steps

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Baseline metrics captured; no critical regressions

## Dependencies

- Phases B/C stable features and docs

## Deliverables

- Logging, security results, backup/runbook, load test report

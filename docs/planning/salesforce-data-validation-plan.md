# Salesforce Data Validation System Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive system to validate data integrity between the Volunteer Management System (VMS) and Salesforce source data. The system will ensure that imported data is not only complete in terms of record counts but also accurate in terms of field values, relationships, and business logic.

## Current State Analysis

### Import Processes
- **Volunteers**: Comprehensive import with 40+ fields including demographics, skills, contact info, and Connector data
- **Organizations**: Full organizational data with affiliations and relationships
- **Events**: Session data with participant tracking and status management
- **Students**: Academic and demographic information with school affiliations
- **Teachers**: Educational staff data with class associations
- **History**: Activity tracking and volunteer engagement records
- **Pathways**: Career development program data and participation

### Existing Validation
- Basic error counting during import
- Transaction rollback on failures
- Field-level validation (e.g., enum mapping, date parsing)
- Duplicate detection for student participations

## Validation System Architecture

### 1. Fast Tests (Daily/Weekly)
Quick validation checks that can run frequently without significant performance impact.

### 2. Slow Tests (Monthly/Quarterly)
Comprehensive validation that requires deeper analysis and may take longer to complete.

### 3. Real-time Monitoring
Continuous validation during import processes and data updates.

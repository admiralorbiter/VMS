  - Industry Focus: "Career in...", "Working in..." â†’ career guidance, industry knowledge
  - Project-Based: "Building...", "Creating..." â†’ hands-on, project work, creation
  - Knowledge Discovery: "Understanding...", "Exploring..." â†’ research, exploration, investigation
  - Relationship Building: "Connecting...", "Networking..." â†’ networking, collaboration, partnerships
  - Preparation: "Preparing for...", "Getting Ready for..." â†’ planning, preparation, readiness

- **Semantic Context Analysis**: Understands emotional and contextual meaning
  - Emotional/Engagement: inspiring, motivating â†’ motivation, inspiration, empowerment
  - Problem-Solving: solving, addressing, challenges â†’ problem solving, critical thinking, analytical
  - Innovation/Creativity: innovative, creative, groundbreaking â†’ innovation, creativity, breakthrough
  - Leadership/Management: leading, managing, coordinating â†’ leadership, management, supervision
  - Community/Service: community, service, volunteering â†’ community service, helping others, social impact

- **Dynamic Characteristics**: Adapts to event complexity and audience level
  - Event Complexity: Title length analysis for detailed vs. focused events

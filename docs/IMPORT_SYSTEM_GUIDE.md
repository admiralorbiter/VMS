### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Volunteers with affiliations but no organization assignments
**Cause**: The organization ID doesn't correspond to an organization in the database
**Solution**:
1. Import the missing organization from Salesforce
2. Or update the affiliation in Salesforce to point to an existing organization

#### Issue: Volunteers with no affiliation data
**Cause**: Missing `npe5__Contact__c` or `npe5__Organization__c` data in Salesforce
**Solution**: Update the affiliation records in Salesforce to include proper contact and organization data

#### Issue: Import performance issues
**Cause**: Large datasets overwhelming the system
**Solution**: The optimized framework automatically handles this through batch processing and memory management

### Best Practices

#### 1. **Run Phase 1 First**
Always run the volunteer import (Phase 1) before affiliation assignment (Phase 2).

#### 2. **Monitor the Pipeline**
Check the pipeline status regularly to identify issues early.

#### 3. **Import Organizations First**
Ensure organizations are imported before running Phase 2 (affiliations import).

#### 4. **Validate Data Quality**
Ensure Salesforce data is clean and complete before importing.

#### 5. **Use the Optimized Framework**
Prefer the new optimized imports over legacy options for better performance and reliability.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Students with affiliations but no school assignments
**Cause**: The affiliation ID doesn't correspond to a school in the database
**Solution**:
1. Import the missing school from Salesforce

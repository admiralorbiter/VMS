# VMS Decision Log (ADR Index)

## üìã **Overview**

This document serves as the central index of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) across all VMS projects.

ADRs are immutable records of significant technical decisions that capture the context, decision, and consequences for future reference.

## üîç **ADR Search & Filtering**

### **By Project**
- **Global**: System-wide decisions
- **Validation System**: Data validation and quality decisions
- **GUI Enhancements**: User interface and experience decisions
- **Data Integration**: Salesforce and external system decisions

### **By Decision Type**
- **Technology**: Framework, language, and tool choices
- **Architecture**: System design and structure decisions
- **Data**: Database, storage, and data flow decisions
- **Integration**: External system and API decisions

### **By Status**
- **Accepted**: Decision implemented and in use
- **Proposed**: Decision under consideration
- **Deprecated**: Decision superseded by newer approach
- **Archived**: Decision no longer relevant

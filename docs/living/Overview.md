# Volunteer Management System (VMS) - System Overview

## üéØ Project Purpose

The Volunteer Management System (VMS) is a centralized web-based application designed to streamline volunteer data management, event tracking, and reporting for educational organizations.

The system serves as a single source of truth for volunteer activities while integrating with external systems like Salesforce.

### Primary Goals
- **Centralize volunteer data** from multiple sources (Salesforce, internal datasets, attendance logs)
- **Track events and attendance** with comprehensive reporting capabilities
- **Provide actionable insights** through detailed analytics and reports
- **Support district coordinators** and internal teams in volunteer management
- **Enable data-driven decisions** through comprehensive reporting

## üóÑÔ∏è **Data Model Architecture**

### **Core Design Pattern**
The VMS system uses **polymorphic inheritance** where `Contact` is the base class, and `Volunteer`, `Teacher`, and `Student` inherit from it. This allows for shared contact information while maintaining specialized data for each type.

### **Key Entities & Relationships**
- **Contact Base**: Shared fields (name, email, phone, demographics)
- **Volunteer**: Organization details, volunteer history, interests
- **Teacher**: School association, subject areas, grade levels
- **Student**: School enrollment, grade progression, participation
- **Organization**: Partner relationships, contact management
- **Event**: Volunteer activities, attendance tracking
- **School/District**: Local entity management and validation

### **Database Design Principles**
- **Normalization**: Follows relational database best practices
- **Performance**: Optimized for complex volunteer and event queries
- **Integrity**: Comprehensive foreign key relationships and constraints
- **Audit Trail**: Full change tracking and history maintenance

## üîç **Data Quality & Validation**

### **Validation Coverage**
- **Volunteer**: 1,816 validation checks across all types
- **Event**: 1,075 validation checks across all types
- **Student**: 15 validation checks across all types
- **Teacher**: 325 validation checks across all types
- **Organization**: 49 validation checks across all types
- **School**: 28 validation checks (Local Entity)
- **District**: 21 validation checks (Local Entity)

### **Validation Types**
1. **Count Validation** - Record synchronization accuracy
2. **Field Completeness** - Required field population
3. **Data Type Validation** - Format and type consistency
4. **Relationship Validation** - Referential integrity
5. **Business Rules** - Workflow and logic compliance

## üîí Session Cookie Security

The application enforces hardened cookie flags:

- Session cookies: HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax; Secure in production, not required in local dev.
- Remember-me cookies: HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax; Secure in production, not required in local dev.

Environment variables:

- `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` (default `vms_session`)
- `REMEMBER_COOKIE_NAME` (default `vms_remember`)
- `SESSION_LIFETIME_SECONDS` (default 28800, i.e., 8 hours)

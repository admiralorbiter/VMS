# Volunteer Management System (VMS) - System Overview

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The Volunteer Management System (VMS) is a centralized web-based application designed to streamline volunteer data management, event tracking, and reporting for educational organizations. The system serves as a single source of truth for volunteer activities while integrating with external systems like Salesforce.

### Primary Goals
- **Centralize volunteer data** from multiple sources (Salesforce, internal datasets, attendance logs)
- **Track events and attendance** with comprehensive reporting capabilities
- **Provide actionable insights** through detailed analytics and reports
- **Support district coordinators** and internal teams in volunteer management
- **Enable data-driven decisions** through comprehensive reporting

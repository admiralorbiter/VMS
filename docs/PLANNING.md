# 🧱 Foundation-to-Finish Planning Document

A roadmap to solidify core features, improve reliability, and build documentation useful to humans and AI.

---

## 0. Snapshot of Current State

| Area | Strengths | Gaps & Risks |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Feature coverage** | Strong event/org/volunteer reporting features implemented | Import automation and some modules unfinished (e.g. “Schools”, “Client Projects”) |
| **README** | Setup & stack described well | Missing architecture overview, data flow, contributor info |
| **Testing & CI** | `pytest` and coverage hooks exist | No lint/type CI; no coverage gate |
| **Data sync** | Salesforce + spreadsheet import partially implemented | Sequential import and error alerting not complete |
| **Documentation tooling** | Markdown already in use | No consistent structure, AI-readable cues, or doc site generation |

---

## 1. Documentation Layout

Create a new `/docs` folder and add these files:

```
/docs/
├── 01-overview.md
├── 02-architecture.md
├── 03-data-model.md
├── 04-api-spec.md
├── 05-dev-guide.md
├── 06-ops-guide.md
├── 07-test-guide.md
├── 08-release-notes/
├── 09-faq.md
├── FEATURE_MATRIX.md
└── templates/
```

**Bonus**: Add `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and `/checklists/`.

## 2. Step-by-Step Execution Plan

### 🟢 Phase A – Establish Baseline (Week 1)

- [x] Create `docs/` folder structure
- [x] Improve README:
  - Add architecture summary or Mermaid diagram
  - Add project purpose at top
- [ ] Setup pre-commit:
  - [ ] Install pre-commit: `pip install pre-commit`
  - [ ] Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with:
    - [ ] `black` for code formatting (line length: 88, target Python: 3.8+)
    - [ ] `isort` for import sorting (profile: black, line length: 88)
    - [ ] `flake8` for linting (max line length: 88, ignore: E203, W503)
    - [ ] `bandit` for security scanning (exclude: tests/, confidence: medium)
    - [ ] `mypy` for type checking (optional, strict mode)
    - [ ] `pre-commit-hooks` for basic git hooks
  - [ ] Install git hooks: `pre-commit install`
  - [ ] Add pre-commit to requirements-dev.txt
  - [ ] Test pre-commit: `pre-commit run --all-files`
  - [ ] Add pre-commit to VS Code settings (optional)
- [ ] Add CI fail on test or lint failure:
  - [ ] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
    - [ ] Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 matrix testing
    - [ ] Install dependencies from requirements.txt
    - [ ] Run pre-commit checks on all files
    - [ ] Run pytest with coverage reporting

- [ ] Create data dictionary (field names/types/enums)
- [ ] Add AI-readable YAML frontmatter to all docs:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "Volunteer Directory"
  description: "Search, edit, import volunteers"
  tags: [volunteer, ui, admin]
  ---
  ```

### 🟢 Phase D – Ops & QA (Week 5)

- [ ] Add `structlog` and request IDs
- [ ] Run `bandit` and secret scanners
- [ ] Document backup + restore in `06-ops-guide.md`

## 4.1. Code Quality & Automation Tools Deep Dive

### 🔧 **Code Formatting Tools**

| Tool | Purpose | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|------|---------|------|------|----------------|
| **Black** | Uncompromising code formatter | Zero configuration, consistent, fast | No customization, opinionated | ✅ **Primary choice** |
| **autopep8** | PEP 8 compliant formatting | Highly configurable, follows standards | Slower, more complex setup | ⚠️ Alternative if Black too strict |
| **yapf** | Yet Another Python Formatter | Very configurable, Google style | Complex configuration, slower | ⚠️ For teams needing flexibility |

### 🧹 **Import Sorting & Organization**

| Tool | Purpose | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|------|---------|------|------|----------------|
| **isort** | Import statement sorting | Black-compatible, configurable | Can conflict with other tools | ✅ **Primary choice** |
| **reorder-python-imports** | Import reordering | Handles complex cases | Less configurable, slower | ⚠️ For complex import scenarios |

### 🔍 **Linting & Style Checking**

| Tool | Purpose | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|------|---------|------|------|----------------|
| **flake8** | Style guide enforcement | Fast, configurable, widely adopted | Can conflict with Black | ✅ **Primary choice** |
| **pylint** | Comprehensive code analysis | Very thorough, detailed reports | Slow, many false positives | ⚠️ For deep code analysis |
| **pycodestyle** | PEP 8 style checker | Simple, focused | Limited functionality | ⚠️ Lightweight alternative |

### 🛡️ **Security & Vulnerability Scanning**

| Tool | Purpose | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|------|---------|------|------|----------------|
| **bandit** | Security linter | Python-specific, good coverage | Limited to Python | ✅ **Primary choice** |
| **safety** | Dependency vulnerability checker | Comprehensive DB, fast | Only checks dependencies | ✅ **Combine with bandit** |
| **semgrep** | Security-focused static analysis | Multi-language, rule-based | Complex setup, false positives | ⚠️ For advanced security needs |

### 🔍 **Type Checking (Optional)**

| Tool | Purpose | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|------|---------|------|------|----------------|
| **mypy** | Static type checker | Excellent type checking, configurable | Can be strict, slower | ✅ **For type-safety focus** |
| **pyre** | Facebook's type checker | Very fast, good error messages | Less mature, fewer features | ⚠️ For performance-critical projects |

### 🚀 **Additional Automation Tools**

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **pre-commit-hooks** | Basic git hooks | Always - provides essential checks |
| **commitizen** | Conventional commit messages | For semantic versioning |
| **cz changelog** | Automated changelog generation | With commitizen |
| **coverage** | Test coverage reporting | Always - track test quality |
| **tox** | Multi-environment testing | For complex Python version support |

### 📋 **Recommended Tool Stack for VMS**

**Essential (Start Here):**
1. **Black** + **isort** (formatting)
2. **flake8** (linting) 
3. **bandit** (security)
4. **pre-commit** (automation)

**Enhanced (Phase 2):**
5. **mypy** (type checking)
6. **safety** (dependency security)
7. **commitizen** (commit standards)

**Advanced (Phase 3):**
8. **semgrep** (advanced security)
9. **tox** (multi-environment testing)
10. **coverage** (coverage gates)

### ⚙️ **Configuration Strategy**

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with Black + isort + flake8 + bandit
2. **Gradual Enhancement**: Add tools one at a time, test thoroughly
3. **Team Consensus**: Ensure team agrees on tool choices and configurations
4. **Performance Balance**: Balance thoroughness with build speed
5. **False Positive Management**: Configure tools to minimize noise

### 📁 **File Structure After Implementation**

```
VMS/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml
├── requirements.txt
├── requirements-dev.txt
├── pyproject.toml (optional)
├── setup.cfg (optional)
├── .flake8
├── .bandit

    └── 05-dev-guide.md
```

### ⚠️ **Common Pitfalls & Solutions**

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Black vs flake8 conflicts | Different line length settings | Use `extend-ignore = [E203, W503]` in flake8 |
| Import sorting conflicts | isort vs Black formatting | Use `profile = black` in isort config |
| Slow pre-commit runs | Running on all files | Use `--files` flag for specific files |
| CI timeout | Too many tools running | Parallelize tools, cache dependencies |
| False positive security alerts | Generic rules | Configure exclusions in `.bandit` |

- [ ] Review pre-commit hook performance
- [ ] Check for new tool versions
- [ ] Review CI build times

**Monthly:**
- [ ] Update tool configurations based on team feedback

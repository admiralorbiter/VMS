District Model Module
====================

This module defines the District model for managing school districts in the VMS system.
It provides core district information storage and Salesforce integration capabilities.

Key Features:
- School district information management
- Salesforce integration for data synchronization
- One-to-many relationship with schools
- District code and name tracking
- Unique Salesforce ID mapping
- Indexed fields for performance optimization

Database Table:
- district: Stores school district information

District Management:
- District name and identification
- District code for external references
- Salesforce record synchronization
- School relationship management
- Data integrity and validation

Salesforce Integration:
- Bi-directional synchronization with Salesforce
- District record mapping and tracking
- Unique ID constraints for data consistency
- Indexed fields for fast lookups

Relationships:
- One-to-many with School model (defined in school_model.py)
- Many-to-many with Event model through event_districts
- One-to-many with DistrictYearEndReport model
- One-to-many with DistrictEngagementReport model

Performance Features:
- Indexed salesforce_id for fast lookups
- Auto-incrementing primary key
- Optimized query patterns
- Efficient relationship management

Usage Examples:
    # Create a new district
    district = District(
        name="Kansas City Public Schools",
        district_code="KCPS",
        salesforce_id="0011234567890ABCD"
    )

    # Find district by Salesforce ID
    district = District.query.filter_by(salesforce_id="0011234567890ABCD").first()

    # Get district's schools (relationship defined in School model)
    schools = district.schools

        - Indexed salesforce_id for fast lookups
        - Auto-incrementing primary key
        - Optimized query patterns
        - Efficient relationship management

    Data Validation:
        - District name is required
        - Salesforce ID is unique when present
        - District code is optional but indexed
        - Auto-incrementing ID for internal references

    Note: The relationship with schools is defined in the School model to avoid
    circular references. See models/school_model.py for the relationship definition.
